# Reflection: YouTube Content Playbook

## AI Brainstorming Transcript / Summary
The project began with using AI to help brainstorm potential capstone artifacts that would deliver business value, be achievable in one week, and align with my career goals in front-end web development and content creation. Initially, I had trouble liking the project ideas AI suggested. While it offered playbook-style concepts, I decided to contribute my own ideas and focus on a **YouTube Content Playbook**, because I have recent experience with all the features included in the app. These steps were fresh in my mind, and I was confident in their accuracy and usefulness.

AI was particularly helpful in:
- Structuring pages and content organization.
- Suggesting how to break the project into clear sections with actionable guidance.
- Providing fast and easy hosting options. Since I already use GitHub Pages but needed a place to host this project, AI suggested several platforms. I ultimately chose **Netlify**, which I will likely use for future projects.

## Why I Chose This Artifact
I chose the **YouTube Content Playbook** because it:
- Is a **static front-end project**, showcasing my HTML/CSS skills in a clean, professional format.
- Delivers **practical business value** by helping aspiring content creators launch their channels efficiently.
- Allows me to demonstrate both **technical skills and user-focused design**, which is appealing to employers.
- Is **portfolio-ready** and can be deployed quickly on Netlify for easy viewing.
- Reflects **personal experience**, making the steps and recommendations accurate, reliable, and actionable.

## What Worked, What Didn’t, and What I Learned About Using AI
**What Worked:**
- AI was very helpful in generating initial project ideas and page structures.
- AI helped clean up HTML/CSS code, ensuring consistent formatting and readability.
- AI suggested hosting solutions quickly, helping me identify Netlify as an easy, fast, and free option for deployment.

**What Didn’t Work:**
- Many of the AI-generated project ideas were not aligned with my preferences, requiring me to contribute my own concepts.
- Some of the suggestions needed refinement, so I incorporated my own knowledge and recent experience to finalize the project.

**What I Learned:**
- AI is most useful as a **starting point or assistant**, not as a full replacement for the creative and technical work.
- Combining AI suggestions with **personal experience** produces a more polished and professional artifact.
- Using AI to clean and format code can save time, but **understanding the code is essential** to maintain control and ensure quality.
