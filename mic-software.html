        <h2>Connecting the Microphone</h2>
        <p>
            I typically connect my <strong>TASCAM DR-05XP</strong> to the <strong>USB adapter</strong> and then connect it to my phone or laptop. I usually record the audio and visuals separately for better quality and control.
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>TASCAM Step-by-Step Setup</h2>
        <p>
            After connecting the TASCAM to the USB adapter and your device of choice, turn on the TASCAM. Perform a basic setup by setting the current date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, navigate to the <strong>Menu</strong>. Options will appear—click <strong>USB</strong>, then select <strong>AUDIO I/F</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the right of the <strong>CONNECT TO</strong> option, you will see choices like iOS, Mac, or Windows. Select the one that matches your device. After selecting, go down to <strong>CONNECT</strong> and to the right of it, hit <strong>Exec</strong> (Execute). Your TASCAM is now connected to your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Recording Audio</h2>
        <p>
            Once connected, you can record your audio using various software. Personally, I use <strong>iOS Voice Memos</strong> because it is user-friendly and automatically enhances audio. Other software options include <strong>GarageBand</strong>, <strong>Audacity</strong>, or <strong>TASCAM's hi-res Editor</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recommend adding a clap or loud sound in your recording. This helps sync audio and visuals later when editing your video.

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Video Editing & Audio Sync</h2>
        <p>
            For video editing and syncing audio, I use <strong>CapCut</strong>. It is simple to use and displays the audio waveform so you can precisely align audio and video based on the clap or loud sound. If CapCut isn’t available, other options are <strong>Cute Cut</strong> or <strong>Video Star</strong>.
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>
            I typically record audio separately from visuals to ensure maximum quality. Using a clap or other loud sound in your recordings is an easy and effective method to sync your video and audio later. The combination of TASCAM DR-05XP, USB adapter, and compatible software creates a simple, professional workflow for content creation.
